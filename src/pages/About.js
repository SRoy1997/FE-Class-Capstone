        <h1>About my Capstone and what I have learned</h1>

        <p>
          This Capstone contains widgets that I have learned how to build and
          style. It has a Counter, Color Changer, Clock, SWAPI Query, and
          Weather widget.
        </p>

        <p>I have learned so much over the past 15 weeks.</p>

        <p>
          I have learned how to style pages and create whole new applications
          and build my own functions instead of using a library to import
          things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think my biggest takeaway from this course is that I need to believe
          in myself more and not second guess myself. I know how to build and
          application and use the different tools that I have learned, so I just
          need to start trusting my gut.
